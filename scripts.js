/*
 * This javascript file will accomplish three distinct tasks.
 * 
 * 1.) It will use the document ready function to call another function
 * 2.) The other funciton will create a new div w/ text in it, which will be added to index.html. 
 * 		It will also get the JSON data from DRINKS_DATA.json. 
 * 3.) It will have an event handler function for loading the JSON, which will have a console.log 
 * 		to put some data on the page.
